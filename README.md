Bugs and issues: 
For bugs in the library, please fill in an issue in Github as that makes it far easier to track them. 
If possible provide a minimal code snippet that exposes the bug. Also proposals for solutions are welcome.

Issues are not bugs but still possible problematic. E.g. if a library is too slow for your application that is
an issue, not a bug. Please fill in an issue and provide as much details about your requirements.
